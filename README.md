Creating a blog website with Flask; includes user authentication, user profiles, blog posts, and followers.

What I learned:
- Jinja templates, conditions, extensions
- Handling web forms with Flask-WTF: form templates, views, form data, link generation
- Database: SQLite; migrations, models (User, Post, followers)
- Password hashing and verification
- Handling user login and remembering users
- Personal user profile page (about me, etc.) and avatars
- Error handling (404, 500 templates); debugging
- Pagination (showing limited posts)
- Flask-bootstrap for better design
- Localized dates and times

What I want to add:
- More Javascript features (profile info. on hover)
- Custom CSS styling
- Book-specific search
